# ordinal2phase

<!-- badges: end -->

The `ordinal2phase` package provides a suite of statistical tools for
analyzing ordinal outcomes under two-phase sampling designs. This
package accompanies the manuscript: *Two-Phase Sampling Designs and
Analysis Approaches for Ordinal Outcomes*.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ordinal2phase from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("yunbinam128/ordinal2phase")
```

## Example

``` r
library(ordinal2phase)
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->

<!-- summary(cars) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- plot(pressure) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
